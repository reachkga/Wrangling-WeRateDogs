I followed the define, code and test cycle in every problem identified in the assessment step. In the process, I realised that I did not identify many of the important issues in the assessment process. This made me revisit the assessment step multiple times."

    "\n",
    "I have realised that wrangling is a core skillset for any aspiring data scientist. Bulk of the worlds data isn't clean. If we analyse, visualise and model unclean data we will be wasting so much of our time. Some of the visualisations generated wouldn't be possible without wrangling. Therefore, it is imporatant to wrangle our data."
